In this project, we synthesized Gold Nanoparticles and subjected it to different characterization techniques such as X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy(SEM), Ultraviolet Visible Spectroscopy(UV-Visible) to study and understand the physical, electrical and chemical properties of Gold Nanoparticles. 
Characterization is an essential part of materials engineering analysis that helps to identify the right material for specific applications.
